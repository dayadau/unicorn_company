# Executive Summary
Using SQL, I analyzed high-growth trends in unicorn companies by industry. The investment company is interested in average valuation, and top-perform industries. Top-performing industries depend on the number of unicorns and average valuation.

## Business Problems

Structuring the investment portfolio targets the fast-growth unicorns in 2019 - 2021. 

### Questions
- Which industries are leading in terms of unicorn valuations?
- The pace at which high-value companies are emerging within these industries.

## Methodology
- Data Extraction: Loaded data from the unicorns database.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed valuation patterns by industry.
- Industry Comparison: Compute average valuations across industries, group by year to filter the top industries. 
- Visualization: Created a graph to observe the development in quantity and average valuation of the top 3 industries.

## Skills
The SQL functions are used:
- CTE
- Aggregation
- Join
- Date/Time functions
- Filter

## Final note
The project is conducted on DataLab from DataCamp. It is for learning purposes. It may not cover all aspects of investment decision-making and unicorn growth.
